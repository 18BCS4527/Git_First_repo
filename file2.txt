Day1:- Working on code commits to git server and git branchs nd how it works 

To perform any code commits to git server we should have our repo in git server
Step 1: create a repo in git server manual in git hub
Step 2: once done with creating repo follow the commands to move ur local code to the server
Step 3: copy the https url to connect server repo 

Commands:

git remote add origin <httpsUrl>   
git push -u origin master 

git branch -c <banchName>       ---     To create a branch 
git checkout <branchName>       ---     to point our repo to that particular file structure
